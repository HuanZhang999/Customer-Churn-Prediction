# Customer-Churn-Prediction

As customer recruitment is normally expensive, losing customers might be a nightmare for a business.

In churn management, it is important to

    - identify customers who are likely to stop using a service
    - identify factors which trigger the decision

In this project, I build a model based on the random forest method which can be used to serve the two goals mentioned above. The accuracy of the model predictions reached up to 95%. Among all customers, 14.5% tend to churn. The model could successfully identify 70-75% of them. Important factors (ranked) are: total day charge, customer service calls, total evening charge, international plan.
